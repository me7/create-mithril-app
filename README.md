# create-mithril-app
Template for start new Mathril.js application project

## Usage
* clone this repo
* npm install

## Dependency
* [Mithril]() Yeah.., it's required for Mithril project
* [Webpack]() Use for bundle and minify all JS file
* [Webpack-dev-server]() Use for live reload during development `npm run dev`

## Some quirk found
* `npm run dev` then cannot find dist/bundle.js --> because webpack-dev-server run in memory. need to `npm run build` one time to create file
